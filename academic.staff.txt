5. ACADEMIC STAFF
“As the quality of the academic staff is one of the most important components in assuring the quality of higher education, an HEP is expected to search for and appoint the best-suited candidates, to serve its programmes, in an open, transparent and fair manner. To achieve this, HEPs are expected to design and implement an academic staff search and recruitment practice that is as efficient as it is effective to achieve the desired results. It is important that every programme has appropriately qualified and sufficient number of academic staff, working in a conducive environment that attracts talented individuals. The numbers recruited have to be adequate for, and appropriate to, the needs of the programmes. The role of the academic staff in various activities has to be clarified in order to reflect a fair distribution of responsibilities. It is important for the HEP to provide a continuous staff development programme for its academic staff, for them to be current in their knowledge and skills, both in their chosen discipline as well as in their pedagogical skills” (COPPA 2nd Edition, 2017). Academic Staff Development. In order to deliver quality programmes and to produce marketable graduates, competent qualified academic staff must be employed.

Table 5 provides the minimum requirements of the qualifications of academic staff and relevant staff ratios for the different qualification levels in Business Studies.
